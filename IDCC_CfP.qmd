## Proposal for Trust through Transparency: 18th International Digital Curation Conference

\`Open Music Europe\` aims to fill the data gaps that 150 music industry stakeholders had identified for a future permanent data collection program, the European Music Observatory. In our effort, we aim to provide a pilot of a data public-private partnership that connects the best practices of reproducible and open scientific research, open government data reuse, and the use of privately held data in the creation of official statistics. We aim to show that a good public-private partnership can simultaneously improve the quality, timeliness and variety of data available for research, business and official statistics.

The topic of the paper is a practical revision of recent developments in statistical production, particularly about the piloting and development of the use of privately-held data for improving official statistics by the European Statistical System and the UN Statistical Division and some countries, and various open science and open policy analysis initiatives from the scholarly institutions. As a case study, we will show the design of the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database, a linked open data resource that connects a country's collective rights management organisations, music libraries and music heritage organisations to provide the most comprehensive ever database on music works, their sound recordings and notation together with authorship and performer data. We will show how to produce and maintain this dataset using the open collaboration method and open source software and derive a so-called music industry register from it. The concept of the Slovak Music Industry Register serves as a tool of data coordination among privately-held data (for example, royalty accounts of national rights management) and the Slovak statistical authorities and as a tool of ex ante and retrospective harmonisation of official sample surveys conducted by the Slovak statistical authorities and scientific surveying by the Open Music Europe consortium. Contrasting with real-life data governance and technical issues, we will reflect on FAIR, TRUST, statistical quality assurance programs and the metadata standards of DDI and the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange.

# For the paper

"A register aims to be a complete list of the objects in a specific group of objects or population." [@anders_register-based_2007] We are planning music industry registers where the objects are *music works* and *sound recordings* (in statistical terms, music products), and the populations are *music authors*, *music performers*, *groupings of performers* (as the majority of the musicians perform, record, release in groups, ensembles, orchestras), *record labels* (which may be formal and informal businesses) and *music publishers* (enterprises.) From a statistical point of view, our planned music industry registers can be seen as "administrative registers" because they were not initially created for a statistical purpose by a statistical authority.

A *statistical register* is a continuously or regularly updated set of objects for a given population. It contains information on the identification and accessibility of population units as well as other attributes which support the surveying process of the population. It serves as a constantly updated list of potential data sources: people or enterprises, for example, who may be invited to a sample survey or a census. The statistical register is both a coordination tool for data collection (everybody is found who should provide data), and an important data quality management tool (we know if somebody was not found, how it will distort our resulting datasets.)

The *register-statistical processing* includes various procedures to edit and code data, handle missing observations, etc., which are necessary to transform an administrative register that was initially *not* created for statistical data collection (for example, a register of music authors or producers of sound recordings which is created for the collection of royalties) into a statistical register. Or, more precisely in our case, because we aim to create economics statistics compatible with the system of national accounts and existing business statistics, into a *statistical business register (henceforth: SBR)*.

The statistical business register is an essential tool for creating survey frames or sample frames, in other words, to organise statistical data collection. In non-technical terms, this register is necessary to decide who should get a data request.

-   For a *sample survey*, the register is used to draw a lottery of those members of the population who will be invited to provide data.

-   In a *census*-type survey, all registered members of the population, for example, all music labels, will receive an invitation to an interview or form.

-   In the case of *a register-based survey*, all members of the register, for example, all collective management societies in the territory, will be requested to send data directly from their databases.

Particularly register-based surveys are ideal tools for reducing the cost of the survey and the burden on respondents, because it reuses already well-processed data. For example, if we can use a collective management societies royalty accounts systems (with proper data protection) as a data source, we do not have to ask every musician, label or publisher to tell us their revenues in euros from the previous year.

Wallgren: Register-based Statistics â€“ Administrative Data for Statistical Purposes"}

The use of registers and turning them into statistical registers is so essential for creating statistics that the European and Slovak statistical laws allow the official statistical offices to request access to institutional registers of other state bodies for statistical purposes. The use of the tax register to create enterprise data or court registers to create statistics on divorce or criminality is usual in every European country.

The use of non-state registers is getting increasingly common, too. In such cases, a private register (for example, the music work register of SOZA) is based on an agreement between the statistical authority and the private entity. For example, we are well aware of the fact that self-employed musicians, i.e. the majority of the musicians, rarely supply data for statistical purposes because they do not participate either in the Roc-01 or Roc-02 surveys (which form the basis of most structural business statistics in Slovakia) and only randomly selected, and not as musicians, in the LFS-survey, another important source. Creating statistics about industries, activities and products that self-employed professionals dominate may require special registers.

> Self-employed professionals who are nonemployers, i.e. one person enterprises, are frequently under-covered but tend to play a very important role in several ISIC sections (e.g. section M (professional, scientific and technical activities) and class 9000 \[i.e. *performing artists, including musicians -- note by authors*\]). If they are registered with an administrative source they should be included in the SBR. Typical administrative sources are social security files, income tax files, VAT files, files of chambers of commerce and of crafts, government registration files, and lists of doctors. [@un_sbr_guidelines_2020, p. 40.]

We believe that the best registers for the creation of music industry statistics are the registers of the collective management societies -- authors, performers and producers of sound recordings cannot receive some of the royalties without these organisations, so almost all active musicians, and even heirs of deceased musicians are members in these organisations. Another important sources are the catalogues and databases of libraries (which collect information, among other things, on the authors and their published books) or music libraries and music information centers (which collect similar information on published music works.)

Our pilot register is the *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database*, which aims to connect and synchronise various existing registers of published music works and commercially released or archived music sound and video recordings. Because such works are protected or may be protected by copyrights and neighbouring rights, and because the act of publishing (of a work) or a \[commercial\] release (of a recording) reveals not only the music but its title and authors and/or producers and performers, such registers are an ideal first step to create a statistical register, even if this is not their primary function. In our view, the primary function of the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database is to help the promotion and rights management (royalty collection) of all Slovak music abroad as well as in Slovakia and to help new applications that help radio stations to comply with local content regulations, or educators to help the discovery of local, regional and national music for children and their parents, to name a few.

![The re-use of the planned Slovak Comprehensive Music Database as a business register.](png/skcmdb.png){alt="The re-use of the planned Slovak Comprehensive Music Database as a business register."}

Non-statistical registers are playing an increasing role in creating new statistical products from commercial or other sources and even in creating reliable statistics from big data. The UN Structural Business Register---which is very heavily influenced by the most advanced European guidelines---"consider that commercial data available from private companies \[...\] may be considered in the same way as administrative \[*statistical*\] data. Use of such data can be a cost-effective way of improving the SBR since these databases are extensively researched and managed for commercial benefit by their owners. \[...\] Other sources include data collected by companies for their own commercial purposes, for example data owned by market information companies and companies that collect data and maintain directories and databases that they provide to their customers for commercial purposes. [@un_sbr_guidelines_2020, pp. 59-60.]"

Another critical use of a new, non-statistical register (after *register-statistical processing*) may allow the ex ante or ex post (retrospective) harmonisation of official statistical and scientific or business surveys. For example, suppose the offical Roc-02 survey undersamples music enterprises. In that case, we may conduct a similar, voluntary and privately funded survey that collects further music-industry-specific answers in a way that they remains harmonised with the Roc-02 survey. The retrospective harmonisation of answers into a joined database allows the creation of music-industry statistics even if the official Roc-02 sample would not permit such a new division.

A usual approach to extend the functionality of existing statistical registers of statistical offices with minimal complication is to extract parts of the SBR and link it to other data sources, resulting in an *SBR satellite*, which is outside and independent of the SBR. This can alleviate concerns about statistical confidentiality and the mixing of workflows among official statisticians, open science and business users.

> "The SBR may support the satellite approach in different ways. If the units available in one or more frozen frames are linked to data from sources other than those used in the SBR, then the combined result may be a semi-manufactured statistical product blending statistical and administrative data. The difference from a sample is that, in this kind of satellite, information is linked to all units in the underlying population. This approach is useful, for example, to provide economic indicators on self-employed (income estimation) or to compile the regional distribution of production factors to support regional accounting information." [@un_sbr_guidelines_2020, p32]

We see the creation of a *Music Industry Statistical Business Register Satellite* that turns the core units of the *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database* into a *Slovak Music Industry Register*, and after register-statistical processing into SBR Satellite itself, a necessary first step towards the extension of the existing national accounts into a satellite music industry account. This approach may be viable in any European country; however, Slovakia is an excellent place for demonstration because it already has a cultural and creative industries satellite account system (which does not include a music industry account.)

The *Music Industry Statistical Business Register Satellite* would support a high-quality ex ante and ex post survey harmonisation, because it would support the sample design, the administration of the sample, and the harmonisation of statistical procedures (such as handling of missing data) for consistency with official statistical procedures. Whilst survey harmonisation is often explained via the harmonisation of questionnaires, interview situations or the via the retrospective joining of datasets, a high-quality retrospecitve harmonisation and perhaps any ex ante harmonisation requires the broader services that an SBR satellite can offer.

Our rOpenGov statistical ecosystem is already implementing many procedures that are required for such a technical harmonisation: the \[statcodelists\] R package harmonises codebooks; the \[retroharmonize\] package support data joining; for more general tasks, such as missing data handling, statisticians in leading statistical authorities like the Dutch, Finnish or Swedish national offices have made procedures open-source.

While the creation of SBR satellite is commonplace in Europe and even in developing country statistical systems, it is usually initiated by the national statistical office; our approach goes a step further in that it offers to turn a potential commercial data source (which was identified by the Slovak CCI strategy as a potential data source) into a production-ready statistical data source. The combination of open scientific data collection, business data provision, and the creation of an SBR satellite and national account satellites may be the first exploitation of the relatively novel legislative framework of the Open Data Directive, the Data Governance Act, and the EU's open science and evidence-based policy efforts.
