## Privately-held data

`bib/privatelyhelddata.bib`

*European Statistical System Position paper on access to privately held data which are of public interest*

> Statistical surveys and administrative registers are and will remain important sources for the production of official statistics. However, the traditional data gathering methods could be in the future enhanced and enriched by big data analytics. To achieve this, it is essential that data held by private actors can be used by statistical authorities as raw material for innovative value-added services and statistical products, which will also boost the economy by creating new jobs and encouraging investment in data-driven sectors. Increased efficiency and faster delivery by statistical offices of innovative digital products and services will be one of the cornerstones for evidence-based decisions and contribute to lessening the burden on statistical respondents and notably on businesses. Improved access to data would enable statistical offices to provide more granular and timely statistics that would be more useful to enterprises and the citizens alike. It would also mean providing valuable feedback information to the data holders or delivering more tailored statistical services to companies, which might help them in return to better develop their business model. [@ess_position_privately_held_2017 pp. 3-4]

> Finally, concerning the practical modalities to access the data, our experience shows that such access can take a large variety of forms, ranging from access to raw data as collected by the data holder to access to data processed on the basis of algorithms specially designed and provided by statistical experts. Using algorithms provided by the statistical offices could not only reduce the cost of making data available but also represent an additional safeguard with regard to privacy. In general, data holders should be entitled to give access to their data as they are and should not be required to provide them in any specific format. It is indeed generally agreed that the burden on data providers needs to be minimised and data shall be used in their original format. The same approach applies regarding the metadata; without the relevant metadata, data will be of limited use for statistical purposes. It is therefore essential for statistical offices to access these metadata in order to be able to ascertain contents, quality and usability of the data while avoiding any extra burden on data holders and eventually leaving the details open for bilateral discussion depending on the data concerned. More generally, statistical offices are committed to transparency in the methods, algorithms, techniques, tools, etc. they use and this overall commitment should represent an additional incentive for data holders to share their data.

*High-Level Expert Group on Business-to-Government Data Sharing: Towards a European strategy on business-to-government data sharing for the public interest. Final report*

> B2G data-sharing collaborations should be organised: -- in testing environments ('sandboxes') for pilot testing ('pilots') to help assess the potential value of data for new situations in which a product or service could potentially be used ('use cases'), -- via public-private partnerships. [@hleg_towards_b2g_data_2020, p. 8.]

> Data taxonomy In this report, the term 'data' refers to data at all levels of abstraction, from raw data to pre-processed, processed data and insights derived from the data, depending on the use case, the type of data, etc. (for further details, see Annex I: Data taxonomy). Raw data: data collected from a source (e.g. numbers, instrument readings, images, text, videos, sensor data).
>
> Pre-processed data: pre-processing includes, for example, cleaning, instance selection, re-sampling, normalisation, transformation, feature extraction and selection.
>
> Processed data: data processing can be described as the manipulation of data in order to produce meaningful information.
>
> Data-driven insights: are generated by drawing conclusions from processed, analysed data.
>
> All levels of abstraction need to be handled in full compliance with privacy legislation.

> The focus of B2G data sharing is on datasets that the public sector either does not have \> access to or has no way to collect, in addition to situations where the sharing of such data would prevent the duplication of effort and investment in data collection and storage. [@hleg_towards_b2g_data_2020, p23]

> Member States should have in place structures to support B2G data sharing. These structures could be a body (or bodies) tasked with assisting public-sector organisations and private companies or civil-society organisations in entering into new data-sharing partnerships and facilitating the sharing of good practice. Over time, such structures could become trusted third parties between the public and private sectors, by bringing the relevant players together. [@hleg_towards_b2g_data_2020, p. 37]

> All B2G data sharing can ultimately be understood as a form of public-private partnership (PPP). However, from a practical point of view, sandboxes and specific PPPs can be put in place for specific public-interest purposes or to target specific challenges related to B2G data sharing.

## Administrative Data & Statistical registers

`bib/administrativedata.bib`

"A register aims to be a complete list of the objects in a specific group of objects or population." [@anders_register-based_2007] We are planning music industry registers where the objects are *music works* and *sound recordings* (in statistical terms, music products), and the populations are *music authors*, *music performers*, *groupings of performers* (as the majority of the musicians perform, record, release in groups, ensembles, orchestras), *record labels* (which may be formal and informal businesses) and *music publishers* (enterprises.) From a statistical point of view, our planned music industry registers can be seen as "administrative registers" because they were not initially created for a statistical purpose by a statistical authority.

The authoritative source on statistical business registers is the *United Nations Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers. Final draft prior to official editing* [@un_sbr_guidelines_2020] which is heavily based on the former UNECE *Guidelines on statistical business registers* [@unece_sbr_guidelines_2015]. The European guideline is the *European business statistics methodological manual for statistical business registers. 2021 edition* [@eurostat_sbr_manual_2021].
