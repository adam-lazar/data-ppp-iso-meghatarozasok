## Wikibase


We think that VIAF is the most suitable authority control, but the flexibility and functionality of Wikidata makes it a worthy parallel system in itself. 
[@bianchini_beyond_2021; @van_veen_wikidata_2019; @rossenova_wikidata_2022] We reached out to the Wikimedia Foundation and _WMSK_, former official legal name _Wikimedia Slovensk√° republika_ to not only use their open source product, i.e, Wikibase for authority control reconciliation, but as a tool to push our knowledge and our namespace to the Wikidata.

One of our project aim to provide an entry point to provide every music organisaiton and person an identifier on Wikidata, learning from the experience of the _Beyond the Fountain_ project [@siler_beyond_2022]
