Information technology — Vocabulary
Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of document should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of any patent rights identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction and/or on the ISO list of patent declarations received (see www.iso.org/patents).
Any trade name used in this document is information given for the convenience of users and does not constitute an endorsement.

— Missing Introduction and Scope have been added.
0   Introduction
0.1   General
Information technology gives rise to numerous international exchanges of both an intellectual and a material nature. These exchanges often become difficult, either because of the great variety of terms used in various fields or languages to express the same concept, or because of the absence or imprecision of the definitions of useful concepts.
To avoid misunderstandings and to facilitate such exchanges it is essential to clarify the concepts, to select terms to be used in various languages or in various countries to express the same concept, and to establish definitions providing satisfactory equivalents for the various terms in different languages.
ISO 2382 was initially based mainly on the usage to be found in the Vocabulary of Information Processing which was established and published by the International Federation for Information Processing and the International Computation Centre, and in the American National Dictionary for Information Processing Systems and its earlier editions published by the American National Standards Institute (formerly known as the American Standards Association). Published and Draft International Standards relating to information technology of other international organizations (such as the International Telecommunication Union and the International Electrotechnical Commission) as well as published and draft national standards have also been considered.
The purpose of ISO/IEC 2382 is to provide definitions that are rigorous, uncomplicated and which can be understood by all concerned. The scope of each concept defined has been chosen to provide a definition that is suitable for general application. In those circumstances where a restricted application is concerned, the definition may need to be more specific.
While it is possible to maintain the self-consistency of the original individual parts of ISO/IEC 2382, the reader is warned that the dynamics of language and the problems associated with the standardization and maintenance of vocabularies may introduce duplications and inconsistencies. Reducing the number of duplications and inconsistencies was the purpose of updating the standard in database format.
0.2   Editorial changes
The Information Technology Vocabulary Maintenance Team established several change logs that document the editorial changes made to the terminological entries of the multi-part ISO/IEC 2382 standard. Editorial changes included correcting spelling mistakes and typographical errors as well as consolidating duplicate entries. In cases where two or more concepts differed slightly, all entries were kept. These editorial changes, approved by the National Bodies on the Validation Team, were also made to records in the database used to perform the maintenance work.
0.3   Database technical characteristics
In almost all cases, the Maintenance Team modified the terminological entries from all original parts of ISO/IEC 2382 in accordance with the rules stated in ISO 10241:1992. However, the Maintenance Team faced a number of technical limitations specific to the database. For example, the majority of symbols, figures and tables in the original parts were either adapted or not reproduced. In addition, the database did not allow for bold or italic typefaces for terms found in definitions, examples, or notes.
0.4   Presentation of data
The ISO/IEC 2382 HTML file is the output of the database used for the maintenance work. The file includes entries in strict alphabetical order with no assigned entry number, unnumbered notes, and entry numbers from the original parts that appear below the terms ("nn.nn.nn (2382)").
1   Scope
This standard of vocabulary taken from the multi-part ISO/IEC 2382 standard is presented in language-specific order and is intended to facilitate international communication in information technology. It presents, in two languages, terms and definitions of selected concepts relevant to this field.
In order to facilitate their translation into other languages, the definitions are drafted so as to avoid, as far as possible, any peculiarity attached to a language.

logarithm of the number of events in a finite set of mutually exclusive events, that is in mathematical notation H[subscript 0] = log n where n is the number of events
Note 1 to entry: The note in 16.01.03 is applicable to this definition.
Note 2 to entry: The base of the logarithm determines the unit used. Commonly used units are: shannon (symbol: Sh) for logarithms of base 2; natural unit (symbol: nat) for logarithms of base e; and hartley (symbol: Hart) for logarithms of base 10. Conversion table: 1 Sh = 0,693 nat = 0,301 Hart; 1 nat = 1,433 Sh = 0,434 Hart; 1 Hart = 3,322 Sh = 2,303 nat
Note 3 to entry: The decision content is independent of the probabilities of the occurrence of the events.
Note 4 to entry: The number of b-fold decisions needed to select a specific event out of a finite set of mutually exclusive events equals the smallest integer which is greater than or equal to the decision content defined with the logarithm of base b. This is applicable when b is an integer.

mean transinformation content
average transinformation content
mean value of the transinformation content of two events, each in one of two finite sets of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events; in mathematical notation, this measure is T(X,Y) = [...][...] p(x[subscript i],y[subscript j] T(x[subscript i],y[subscript j]) where X = {x[subscript 1] ... x[subscript n]} is the set of events x[subscript i] (i = 1 ... n), Y = {y[subscript 1] ... y[subscript m]} is the set of events y[subscript j] = (1 ... m), T(x[subscript i],y[subscript j]) is the transinformation content of x[subscript i] and y[subscript j], and p(x[subscript i],y[subscript j]), the joint probability that both events occur
Note 1 to entry: The mean transinformation content is symmetric in X and Y. It is also equal to the difference between the entropy of one of the two sets of events and the conditional entropy of this set relative to the other: T(X,Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = T(Y,X)
Note 2 to entry: The mean transinformation content is a quantitative measure of information transmitted through a channel, when X is a specific set of messages at the message source and Y is a specific set of messages at the message sink. It is equal to the difference between the entropy at the message source and the equivocation, or the difference between the entropy at the message sink and the irrelevance.

radial basis function
activation function that is centered at a point specified by the connection weight vector and whose position and width are adjusted by learning
Note 1 to entry: In a radial basis function network, the radial basis functions are the activation functions of the hidden neurons, and constitute a basis set to represent the patterns.
Note 2 to entry: A radial basis function has a maximum or a minimum, in contrast with the usual activation functions that are monotonic. The most used radial basis function is the Gaussian function.
