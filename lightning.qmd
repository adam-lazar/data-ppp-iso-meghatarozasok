## Public-private Partnership

![](images/IDCC24_2.PNG) 

While open data infrastructures are growing fast, we must bare in mind that private infrastructure is growing at an even faster scale. Last weekend, Europeana had 12,416 sound recordings that you could use without restrictions and altogether, 206,280 music sound recordings were made available over ten years. The same amount is made available with excellent intelligent recommenders and free listening options on Spotify in every 2 days. If we can find ways to connect private and public data infrastructures, the benefits are enormous for all cycles of data curation: in some cases, we can save much cost, and in other cases we can enrich the data and build fantastic new public applications, like we plan to in music libraries.

To put the scale of PPP advantages in a different scope, if we placed the music we handle in Slovakia alone on Europeana in our project, we would double Europeana's music collection, even though the Slovak Republic accounts for only 1% of the European Union's population and music creation.

## Slovak Comprehensive Music Database & Listen Local Apps

![](images/Slide3.PNG){fig-align="center"}

In 2020 we made a [feasibility study](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/listen_local_2020/) [@antal_promoting_slovak_2020] where we tried to understand why the Spotify recommender systems do not recommend Slovak music for Slovak people in Slovakia. Needless to say that behind this puzzle is a lot of bias in public music databases against an intersection of non-American, non-English-speaking, and of course, ethic minority of women artists. At the same time, we reviewed the 600 most played songs in the country to see what kind of data problems there were with their rights management--and found out that more than 50% of professionally managed songs had data problems that resulted in late or missed royalty payments.

There are obvious ways how private and public data systems could help each other. 

- [x] Currently, private companies have far bigger datasets and digital libraries than public institutions, but they often try to rely on the knowledge stored in music libraries, on Wikipedia or other public knowledge.
- [x]  Statistical data coordination can result in more complete registers which can improve the data curation for any type of census-like or sampled data collection. Statistics registers can identify every single music creator, entity the publishes music works, or releases sound recordings for the public [@slovak-cult-stat-pilot].
- [x]  Much of the knowledge carriers that public research data systems want to use, such as books, journals, literary and music works, audiovisual material, architecture plans, and photographs currently have an effective copyright management term of around 130 years, or seventy years after the death of the last surviving rightsholder. They have an up-to-date name register, for example, because they must pay royalties monthly, quarterly or annually. They must ensure that a person receives monthly or annual royalties after a marriage or name change for another reason, or that the royalties keep flowing to heirs after the original rightsholder deceases. Synchronising these timely registers with public heritage namespaces would save costs and create a large value.

-   [x] Last, but not least, the private sector has digitized practically all books, cinematic works, music, music sheets, and billions of photographs.

> Take the example of data exchange with statistical agencies. They have unrivalled access to create census-like information (for example, they know of every person who makes music in the Slovak Republic or every enterprise that releases their recordings). Yet rights management organisations have far more timely and accurate information about royalty income than statisticians, who rely on imprecise surveying instead of accessing data from the financial ledgers of music royalty accounts.

## Data coordination

![](images/Slide4-01.PNG)

> Our work is technically challenging because we work with multi-modal data: we have datasets, texts, images, sound recordings and audiovisual files. In 2024, we will only work with textual information and datasets of tabular data. For example, we want to ensure that people can find any Slovak music works in a public data space, listen to a recorded fixation of the work on a licensed streaming platform, and get information about the availability of the music scores in public libraries for lending, or in webshops for buying.

Let us take a very important problem. We often see that many recordings in public archives cannot be listened to by a broader audience, for example, outside a research room, because any rights clearance, even a negative clearance for no need of rights management, would require the identification of works in connections to authors and their recorded manifestations in connection to neighboring rightsholder persons. Often, the identification is missing, errorneous, outdated, or there is no global id present at all.

For a first step of data coordination, we set up -- in cooperation with Wikipedia -- a Wikibase instance that will remain private and will negotiate definitions, titles, headings among the data models and actual databases of the Slovak National Library, music libraries, the Music Centre Slovakia and the rights management organisation SOZA, and the statistical data collection system.

Second, we will use the QID as a temporary PID and ensure, for example, that

1.  A previously *legally* unpublished music work or arrangement receives an ISWC number, because without that ID, it cannot be performed in the public;
2.  we will establish if the recorded manifestation was ever communicated to the public, and whenever possible, release it with an ISRC code;
3.  The *now* published music works's author will get a VIAF entry, because as the work is officially published, at one point it should appear in a public library or repository, even if we do not know yet where.

## Dataspace model

![](images/Slide5.PNG){fig-align="center"}

We are following the dataspace models that had been recommended by several working groups in the past years, for example, the EBU [@dataspace_for_cci_2022]. We also heavily borrow on the work popularised by the EU Open Data portal with the use of Wikibase an identity brokerage and content negotiation tool. (See also [\@ @design_principles_data_spaces_2021].)

## Value proposition for curators

Our value proposition for the research and data curation community,

-   We will provide in the music (and film) domains a much more detailed and accurate description to data registries, data procedures and workflows, authoritative databases in human and RDF langauge. There will be a lot more authoritative or high-quality sources known for public curators about the private side, and for private curators about the public oragnisations.

-   We will also try to bridge in a narrow but interesting domain, i.e., music and film, the various information models of the Statistical Data and Metadata eXhange, CIDOC for heritage, the new Polifonia music ontologies, and the Europeana Data Model and the DCAT-AP specification of the EU Open Data Portal.

-   We will develop novel methods, procedures and workflows relying on novel legal innovations for mixing privately-held and public or state data to ensure a cross-correction of public, private, open and closed registries.

Our work's novelty and greatest challenge so far is the management of different data jurisdictions. Take for example GDPR.

-   [x] Statistical agencies do not apply GDPR, but they use higher standards, and we must use novel data coordination and legal instruments for coordinating statistical registers and frames among state and privately-held data collection systems.

-   [x] Heritage organisations and libraries are often exempted to some degree from using GDPR. For example, they can put the names of many authors into a public library catalogue.

-   [x] Rights management organisations utilise highly detailed personal data about authors concerning their works but must use such data only for rights management, and they fall under very strict GDPR data protection rules.

So we have to find those value propositions where these organisations can fulfill the original purpose of their data mandate better in a partnership, and seek an extension or change in their mandate to take benefit of such new data procedures for the benefit of the final or original data owner.
