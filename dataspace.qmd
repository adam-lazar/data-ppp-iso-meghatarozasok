## Dataspaces

-   *Dataspaces: Fundamentals, Principles, and Technique*: "A dataspace is an emerging approach to data management which recognises that in large-scale integration scenarios, involving thousands of data sources, it is difficult and expensive to obtain an upfront unifying schema across all sources. Data is integrated on an \`\`as-needed'' basis with the labour-intensive aspects of data integration postponed until they are required. Dataspaces reduce the initial effort required to set up data integration by relying on automatic matching and mapping generation techniques." [@curry_dataspaces_2020]

-   *Dataspace for Cultural and Creative Industries* (Position paper): "A data space is an ecosystem of exchange, processing, sharing and provision of data between trusted partners, for a fee or not. It is not about copying or repatriating data centrally, but about ensuring that each data holder has full control over the conditions (e.g., who, when, and under what condition) of access to their data." [@dataspace_for_cci_2022, p16]

-   *Design Principles for Data Spaces* (Position paper): "From a technical perspective, a data space can be seen as a data integration concept which does not require common database schemas and physical data integration, but is rather based on distributed data stores and integration on an “as needed” basis on a semantic level. Abstracted from this technical definition, a data space can be defined as a federated data ecosystem within a certain application domain and based on shared policies and rules." [@design_principles_data_spaces_2021, p7]

-   *Catalog and Entity Management Service for Internet of Things-Based Smart Environments*: "Dataspaces can provide an approach to enable data management in smart environments that can help to overcome technical, conceptual, and social/organisational barriers to information sharing. A fundamental requirement for intelligent decision-making within a smart environment is the availability of information about entities and their schemas across multiple data sources and intelligent systems." [@ulHassan_catalog_entity_management_2020]

-   *Human-in-the-Loop Tasks for Data Management, Citizen Sensing, and Actuation in Smart Environments*: "Humans are playing critical roles in the management of data at large scales, through activities including schema building, matching data elements, resolving conflicts, and ranking results. The application of human-in-the-loop within intelligent systems in smart environments presents challenges in the areas of programming paradigms, execution methods, and task design."

## Functions of data spaces

According to the recommendations of the expert group behind _Design Principles for Data Spaces_, the following requirements need to to be met by data spaces [@design_principles_data_spaces_2021, p26]:

- [x] Data spaces should provide a framework for effective and efficient data exchange, supporting the decoupling of data producers and data consumers. This means they should allow for adoption of common APIs and security schemas, as well as adoption of data models that can be represented in data formats compatible with adopted APIs, for the purpose of sharing and exchanging data.

- [x] Data spaces should provide a structure for defining and enforcing agreements on the use of data (including potential monetization of both data provision and data use). This means they should allow for incorporation of capabilities for specifying and publishing data offerings comprising terms and conditions (including pricing) that can be enforced during data exchange transactions.

- [x] Data spaces should provide a structure for trustworthiness, in which data consumers and data providers can share their business interests on the basis of common ethical values. This means they should provide security capabilities to protect data ownership aspects as well as business operations, including capabilities for privacy protection that can be engineered and deployed. 

- [x]  Data spaces should provide a structure on the basis of which specific policies and regulations can be supported.

### Linked Open Data in Statistics

### Linked Open Data in Libraries

`bib/libraryLOD.bib`

- *Evaluating the quality of linked open data in digital libraries*: Cultural heritage institutions have recently started to share their metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD) in order to disseminate and enrich them. In this report, the methodology defined by previous research for the evaluation of the quality of LOD is analysed and adapted to the specific case of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples containing standard bibliographic information. The specified quality measures are reported in the case of four highly relevant libraries [@CandelaGustavo2022Etqo]

- Evaluating implementation of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines: the TRUST process for rating journal policies, procedures, and practices [@Mayo-Wilson_et_al_evaluating_TOP_2021]

### Linked Open Data in Archives

`bib/archivesLOD.bib`

- The *Records in Contexts–Conceptual Mode* (RiC-CM) reconciles, integrates, builds on, and replaces the four existing standards: General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)); International Standard Archival Authority Records–Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF)); International Standard Description of Functions (ISDF); and International Standard Description of Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH).[@RiC-CM_1_0]

## Reprex 

- - [x] Data spaces should provide a structure for trustworthiness in which data consumers and data providers. The dataspace partners build trust with common ethical values and with the disclosure and addressing of potential conflicts of interest, for example, among private and public institutions, composers, producers and performers. Partners increase trust with high data quality. They minimise biases by excluding groups of artists or genres of music. Data protection rules, including a clear interpretation of GDPR, ensure the balance between public interest and privacy concerns.
