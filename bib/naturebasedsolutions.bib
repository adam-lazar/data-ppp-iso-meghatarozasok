	abstract = {In 2020, Europe faces environmental challenges of unprecedented scale and urgency. Although {EU} environment and climate policies have delivered substantial benefits over recent decades, Europe faces persistent problems in areas such as biodiversity loss, resource use, climate change impacts and environmental risks to health and well-being. Global megatrends such as demographic change are intensifying many environmental challenges, while rapid technological change brings new risks and uncertainties. Recognising these challenges, the {EU} has committed to a range of long-term sustainability goals with the overall aim of ‘living well, within the limits of our planet’. Achieving these goals will not be possible without a rapid and fundamental shift in the character and ambition of Europe’s responses. Europe needs to find ways to transform the key societal systems that drive environment and climate pressures and health impacts — rethinking not just technologies and production processes but also consumption patterns and ways of living. This will require immediate and concerted action, engaging diverse policy areas and actors across society in enabling systemic change. Europe stands at a critical juncture in 2020. Its leaders have opportunities to shape future developments that will not be available to their successors. The coming decade will therefore be of decisive importance in determining Europe’s opportunities in the 21st century. These, in short, are the overarching conclusions of The European environment — state and outlook 2020 ({SOER} 2020). The report provides a comprehensive assessment of Europe’s environment to support governance and inform the public. Like all {EEA} reports, it is founded on the work of the European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet) — a partnership between the {EEA} and its 33 member countries and six cooperating countries.},
